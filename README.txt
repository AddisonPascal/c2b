C2B
I'm making a programming language that compiles to Windows Batch. 
See DOCUMENTATION.c2b.

Files Included:
- C2B Compiler
- C2B Prompt (outdated)
- Documentation
- Batch to Python (doesn't work for ANSI codes)

Example: 
https://gist.github.com/AddisonPascal/15b4cc453787def86a19bf826d94729e

How to Use:
Either clone/download the repository for the development version, or click "Releases" and download the ZIP for the latest release.
Although there are releases, c2b is still before v1, so bugs may be and are present. To submit a bug report, create an issue and select a template.
